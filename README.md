# 🎯 AI Guidance Counselor

**Helping recently graduated high school students discover their best career paths.**

AI Guidance Counselor is a full-stack web application that guides young graduates through the overwhelming transition from school to career. By evaluating a student's personal strengths across eight dimensions of intelligence (based on Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences), the platform uses a trained machine learning model to recommend the most fitting career paths — turning self-reflection into a concrete, data-driven action plan.

---

## ✨ What It Does

1. **Students register and log in** to a secure, personal dashboard.
2. **They complete a self-assessment** rating themselves across eight intelligence dimensions (language, logic, spatial reasoning, interpersonal skills, etc.).
3. **The AI engine processes their scores** through a trained XGBoost classifier.
4. **They receive a ranked shortlist of career recommendations** — not just one answer, but a Top-5 list of professions that match their profile.
5. **An LLM generates a personalized summary** *(planned)* — explaining what the results mean, why these careers suit their profile, and what concrete next steps they can take.

> The system is designed for *exploration*, not prescription — helping students see possibilities they may not have considered.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express.js |
| **Database** | MongoDB (Mongoose ODM) |
| **Authentication** | JWT (Access + Refresh Tokens) |
| **AI / ML** | Python, XGBoost, scikit-learn, pandas |

## 📐 Architecture

### Backend — Layered Architecture

```
Controllers  →  Services  →  Repositories  →  Database
```

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Controllers** | Handle HTTP requests/responses (no business logic) |
| **Services** | All business logic and application rules |
| **Repositories** | Database communication (isolates Mongoose from services) |

### AI Module — ML Pipeline

```
Raw Dataset  →  Cleanup  →  Normalize (0–1)  →  XGBoost Classifier  →  Top-5 Career Predictions
```

The AI module uses a dataset of 3,600 student profiles across 72 unique professions, achieving **98.33% accuracy** on clean data and **~97% Top-5 accuracy** even under simulated human self-assessment error.

## 🔒 Security

- **Authentication & Authorization** — JWT with short-lived access tokens (15 min) and refresh tokens (7 days). Role-based endpoint protection (user / admin).
- **Password Hashing** — bcrypt with 12 salt rounds; passwords are never stored as plain text.
- **Input Validation** — express-validator with sanitization (XSS / injection protection).
- **CORS** — Configured to only allow the authorized client origin.
- **Environment Variables** — All secrets managed via `.env` files (never committed to version control).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v20+
- **MongoDB Community Server** installed and running locally on port `27017` (required for this project to work), or a remote MongoDB Atlas URI.
- **Python** 3.10+ (for the AI module only)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd AI-Guidance-Counselor
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install root and workspace dependencies:
```bash
# Install root dependencies
npm install

# Install server dependencies
cd server && npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend && npm install

# Install AI prediction package requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment

Create the Express backend environment file:
```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your local MongoDB URI and details.
# Secure JWT secrets will be auto-generated or can be filled in manually.
```

### 4. Start the Application

#### Recommended: Start All Concurrently
From the root directory:
```bash
npm run dev
```
*This starts the Flask AI backend (port 5001), Express Node.js server (port 5004), and Vite React frontend (port 5173) concurrently in a single terminal.*

#### Manual Launch (Separate Terminals)
- **AI Flask API**: `python ai/app.py` (running on http://localhost:5001)
- **Express Backend**: `npm run dev --prefix server` (running on http://localhost:5004)
- **Vite React Client**: `npm run dev --prefix frontend` (running on http://localhost:5173)

### 5. Open in Browser

Navigate to **`http://localhost:5173`**

## 💡 Planned Feature: LLM-Powered Career Summary

> **Status:** Planned — not yet implemented.

After the XGBoost model produces a student's Top-5 career predictions, the raw results alone can feel abstract. The next step is to integrate a **Large Language Model (LLM)** that takes the prediction output and generates a **personalized, human-readable summary** for the student.

### How It Would Work

```
Student Assessment  →  XGBoost (Top-5 Predictions)  →  LLM Prompt  →  Personalized Career Summary
```

1. The student completes the self-assessment and receives their Top-5 career matches with confidence scores.
2. The prediction results (career names, scores, and the student's intelligence profile) are passed as context to an LLM.
3. The LLM generates a narrative summary that:
   - **Explains *why*** each career is a good fit based on the student's specific strengths.
   - **Suggests actionable next steps** — relevant university programs, certifications, entry-level roles, or skills to develop.
   - **Highlights connections** between careers the student may not have considered (e.g., "Your high spatial and logical scores make you a strong fit for both architecture *and* data science").

### Model Options Under Consideration

| Approach | Examples | Trade-offs |
|---|---|---|
| **Open-source (self-hosted)** | LLaMA, Mistral, Gemma | Full control, no API costs, privacy-friendly — but requires GPU infrastructure |
| **API-controlled** | OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude | Easy to integrate, high quality — but introduces API costs and external dependency |

The final choice will depend on deployment constraints, cost, and privacy requirements. Both approaches are viable — the LLM receives only the prediction output and intelligence scores (no sensitive personal data beyond what the student entered).
